# Write a function that counts the number of times a given letter appears in a string.
# The function should take two arguments: the string and the letter to be counted.
# The function should return the number of times the letter appears in the string.
# For example, the function call count("banana", "a") should return 3 (because "a" appears 3 times in "banana").

def count(string, letter):
    # Replace the pass statement with your code
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(count("banana", "a")) # 3
    print(count("banana", "b")) # 1
    print(count("banana", "c")) # 0
    print(count("banana", "n")) # 2
    print(count("banana", "z")) # 0
    print(count("banana", " ")) # 0
