# Write a function that counts and returns how many non-overlapping occurences of a substring appear in a string.
# Hint: you can use continue to skip an iteration.
# For example, the function call count_substring('love', 'love love love') should return 3
# The function call count_substring('is', 'This is a test. Is this a test?') should return 3
# The function call count_substring('are', 'are you sure you are sure?') should return 2

def count_substring(substring, string):
    # Replace the pass statement with your code
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(count_substring('love', 'love love love')) # 3
    print(count_substring('is', 'This is a test. Is this a test?')) # 3
    print(count_substring('are', 'are you sure you are sure?')) # 2
